    "usage": "Clomisign 100 mg is indicated for women who have difficulty conceiving due to ovulation problems (i.e., anovulatory or oligo-ovulatory infertility). It works by binding to estrogen receptors in the hypothalamus, tricking the body into thinking estrogen levels are lower than they are, thereby increasing the release of gonadotropins (FSH and LH) which stimulate the ovaries to produce and release eggs. \r\n\r\nBy inducing ovulation, Clomisign increases the chance of timely fertilization when intercourse or intra-uterine insemination is appropriately timed.",
